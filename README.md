## Context
Instacart is an app for an online grocery store and they are interested in finding patterns or insights about their sales. The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis of their data to derive insights and suggestions based on their customer's buying habits. This project is designed to aid in developing a targeted marketing strategy based on different customer needs. 

## Objectives
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tage. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groups to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular that others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviours differ. 

## Tools
Python libraries: Pandas for data exploration, seaborn for data visualization
